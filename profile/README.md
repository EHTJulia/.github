This GitHub Organization aims to provide a Julia software suite
for radio astronomy data sets using technique of radio interferometry to the broad astronomy community. Julia packages developed in this organization implement calibration, imaging, analysis algorithms and techniques originally developed for the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and a next generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT).
